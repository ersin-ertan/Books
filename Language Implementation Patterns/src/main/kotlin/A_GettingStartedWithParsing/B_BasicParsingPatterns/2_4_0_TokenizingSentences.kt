/*
We unconsciously combine letters into words recognizing grammatical structure. Morse code forces us to go letter by letter.
Recognizers that feed off character streams are called tokenizers or lexers(like LL(1) recursive descent lexer)
Overall sentence has structure, the individual tokens have structure. At the character level, we refer to syntax as the
lexical structure.

Grammars describe language structures, so we can also use them for lexical specifications.
