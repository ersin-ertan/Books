package VII

// Practise every day, think about space and time efficiency
// Code on paper
// Test code on paper
// Put paper into code 1:1 to verify

// Must have:
// linked list, trees, tries, graphs, stacks, queues, heaps, vectors, arraylists, hashtabes
// Breadth first search, depth first search, binary search, merge sort, quick sort, (cassowary?)
// bit manipulation, memory(stack heap), recursion, dynamic programing, big O time and space

// Power of 2
// 7(128), 8(256), 10(1024) 1KB, 16(65,536) 64KB, 20(1,048, 576) 1MB, 30(1,073,741,824) 1GB

// Walking through a problem:
// listen and look at description, examples may be to smmall or special cases, debug it, brute force solution, optimize
// bottlenecks, usless work, duplicated work, walk through optimal solution, implement, test

// Bottlenecks: if the outer loop is not optimized then the inner will eat it

// Consider the operations, and consider which data structure suits it best

// Best Conceivable Runtime(BCR) Best and can prove it, has nothing to do with implementation

// Is working with sorted data helpful for the solution

// Negotiate with exact figures and numbers, ask for what you want, advance your career
