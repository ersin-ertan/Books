// control flow in higher order functions

// returning from enclosing function

// using the return keyword in a lambda returns from the function in which you called the lambda, not from the lambda
// thus is called a non local return, returning to the larger block than the block containing the return statement

// The return from the outer function is possible only if the function that takes the lambda as an argument is inlined
