Focus: How domain models evolve in the solution architecture.

Piece wise composition of pure functions.

What is the domain model? Related of the problem domain. They must be mapped to solutions in the solution architecture.

Use composition of pure functions and types. Functions compose when the algebra of types align.

Services,filters, futures compose algebraically

Higher order functions and effects help build scalable software in two ways. Build software from simple parts makes it
easy to understand, test, reuse and replace individual components. Effects makes side effecting operations tractable,
promoting modularity.

Can you model your domain model as a collection of functions(simple yes), real world each smaller simpler bounded contexts
domain models.


Same as Functional patterns in domain modeling!
