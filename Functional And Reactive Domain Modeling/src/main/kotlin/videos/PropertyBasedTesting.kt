Property based Testing for Functional Domain Models

Synergy to functional programming. Immutable data referential transparency, problem with xUnit is that test cases must be
crafted. Knowledge of the domain data is required. Might miss edge cases.

Generative data, make rules explicit and part of build process.

Properties and what to verify, and how.
